		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Summary:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">9Axes, based off of 8values is a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages on nine different political axes. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage.</p>
		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Details:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">The program was based on 8Values quiz, from which it got a lot of the front-end stuff. Most of the back-end had to be rewritten to deal with the massive amount of questions and modes to take it all or a representative sample.</p>
