		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Details:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">The long awaited sequel to the popular game Pokemon Go, Pokemon Stop provides a brand new experience, even for long time Pokemon players. In fact, the game offers none of the typical catch them all, or battling, and instead focuses on the life of pokemon trainers-to-be before their 10th birthday. The game is a tragic tale that explores the experience of childhood and the restrictions that can block them from fulfilling their dreams and the devolution of those dreams into the simple expectations of children. Featuring signboards, lots of jumping, and everybody's favorite pokemon, Pikachu, Pokemon Stop is the perfect game for all ages. -TotallyUnbiasedRatingsITotallyDidn'tJustMakeUp [Disclaimer - I totally did just make that up and the game isn't half as great as I made it sound]</p>
