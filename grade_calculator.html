		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">A java program that calculates current grade and average grade needed on remaining assignments to get a desired grade</p>
		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Details:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">A program written in java to optimize my schedule of classes, using javafx for graphics. The program will find times that do not collide, then prefer the options with the preferred professors specified. After that it sorts to avoid back to back classes and 8ams (if set to avoid those). It also prioritizes classes based on user-set professor preferences, and won't put classes back to back if their locations are set as "too far". It provides the codes to register for the classes, and if the classes are full, it can quickly reoptimize a schedule with the classes registered. The program also provides information about the professor and location of the classes. The program now also suggests classes to take in order to optimize taking the most classes you want to take with the least risk before graduating. The program can load class times from courseoff or buzzport using the menus. Graphics have improved  as well and schedules can be saved and loaded.</p>
