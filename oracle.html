		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">An IRC/Terminal bot that can produce the answer it knows that has the most similar question to the question it was given.</p>
		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Details:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">The bot essentially uses Nearest Neighbor, but the method for doing it weights how often words are used in its questions - such that words like "the" get little weight, while words only used in one question are weighted more.</p>
