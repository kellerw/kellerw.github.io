		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Summary:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">A java hotseat implementation of the board game Risk for 3-6 players</p>
		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Details:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">​The board game Risk programmed in java using java swing for graphics. I designed nearly all of the graphics and user interface for interacting with the gamestate, as well as implemented most of the mechanisms that dealt with attacking, moving, and placing units. The game is fully functional, and can be played with 3-6 players. We made the "house rules" decision to implement that unlimited units could be moved per turn in the fortify step, but only to an adjacent city, and only if those units did not attack that turn.</p>
