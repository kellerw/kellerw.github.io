		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Summary:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">A website that allows people to view and listen to the currently trending music from various countries (currently supports 12 countries).</p>
		<h2 style="color:#DDDDDD">Details:</h1>
		<p style="color:#DDDDDD">WorldTune is a redefined music application. It streams the most popular songs in a country. The songs update every 24 hours. It is the brainchild of Rahul Mittal who came up with this idea of streaming music, sorting it specifically country wise. The project was created during HackGT by Rahul Mittal, Thor Keller and Jerry Chang. While Jerry designed the interface, Rahul worked in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to make the front end interactive and user-friendly. Thor handled the backend, using PHP, Java, and Python to scrape the web for the most popular songs. The program uses java to run python programs to scrape the web for the top music by country, then run the php program to generate the html and javascript output which is delivered. The java program, if left running, updates once every day. </p>
